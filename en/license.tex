This book would not be what it is without the help of many.
In particular, I wish to thank David Lutterkort for writing Augeas and providing great insights about Augeas internals.
Doing proper typesetting with \LaTeX can be tricky, and Damien Wyart deserves a big thanks for providing his expertise on the subject.
